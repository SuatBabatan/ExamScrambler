# ExamScrambler

If you need more than 1 version of your multiple choice exam this is for you:)
It not only scrambles the order of the questions but also the multiple choices too. Give you the answer key as well :)


I have done this after listening to my of my teacher friend about needing multiple versions of an exam and thought to myself this should be a programs job.
This script was tested on an unfinished exam and unfortunately I cannot put it here before exam is done to students. Will add it here later
